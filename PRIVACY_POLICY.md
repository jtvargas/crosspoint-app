# Privacy Policy

**CrossX (SendToX4)**
**Effective Date:** February 16, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026

## Overview

CrossX ("the App") is developed by Jonathan Taveras Vargas. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our practices.

**In short: CrossX does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Information We Collect

**None.** CrossX does not collect any personal information, usage data, analytics, or telemetry of any kind.

## Data Storage

All data generated by the App — including conversion history, device settings, queued EPUB files, and activity logs — is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device except when you explicitly transfer files to your e-reader over a local WiFi connection.

## Network Communication

CrossX communicates **only** with your Xtreink X4 e-reader over a direct local WiFi connection. The App:

- Does **not** connect to any remote servers, cloud services, or external APIs.
- Does **not** transmit any data over the internet.
- Does **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The only network traffic the App generates is HTTP communication with your e-reader on your local network for the purpose of file transfer and device management.

## Third-Party Services

CrossX does **not** integrate with or send data to any third-party services. There are no:

- Analytics or crash reporting SDKs
- Advertising networks
- Social media trackers
- Cloud storage services
- User authentication services

## Web Content Fetching

When you convert a web page to EPUB, the App fetches the HTML content of the URL you provide. This request is made directly from your device to the target website — the same as visiting the page in a web browser. No intermediary server is involved, and the fetched content is processed entirely on your device.

## Cookies and Tracking

CrossX does **not** use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or any other tracking technologies.

## Children's Privacy

CrossX does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The App is safe for users of all ages.

## Data Sharing and Selling

We do **not** sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share any user data with third parties. There is no user data to share.

## Your Rights

Since CrossX does not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete from our end. All App data is stored locally on your device and can be managed or deleted through the App's Settings or by uninstalling the App.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
